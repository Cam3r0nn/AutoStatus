Nobody flexin' as much as I be
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
GothBoiClique make a ho shake
I was a reject, I was a poser
I swear, I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Cocaine all night long
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
Switchblades, cocaine
I want a Z3, that's a two-seater, boy
Okay, I pull my cash out, shawty pass out
Take her ass out, then I spaz out
I got death notes, where my list at?
Yeah, I'm in my zone now, I put my phone down
I'm never comin' home now, all alone now
Now you actin' like a ghost, girl
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
Long nights, gettin' high on the coast, girl
You got a big gun? Who you shot, boy? (Huh?)
We call you a opp, boy, yeah (We call you a opp, boy)
Why the fuck you lyin' in the streets?
You ain't on the block, boy
I'm a mothafuckin' schema boy, I'm a dreamer boy
Yeah, you got a Glock, boy, yeah
Isnâ€™t life beautiful, I think that life is beautiful
I'll make it look easy, believe me, we gucci
Young punk bitch fuckin' on a young bitch
Shawty fell in love, now she doin' all my drugs, Yung Bruh
Got my switchblade, tonight you'll be safe
I'm in your driveway, baby, lets skrrt away (Skrr, skrr, skrr)
I used to think I love you, now I know it ain't true
Bitch, I know you see me, shinin' in my white tee, it's easy
Fell in love once, and I never been the same
I just fell in love with a bad bitch
Look me in the eyes, girl, we are not the same
Smokin' propane with my clique and the bad bitches
Bitch, I'll make it rain on my side bitch, shoutout to my main
She said, "Why you got so many tattoos?"
So when your daddy see me out, he know I'm bad news
She said, "Why you always wear them black boots?"
I cannot, and I will not ever be stuck
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Twice the effort, under pressure
Walk away as the door slams
I just wanted to help, now I'm goin' to hell
You told me you loved me, do you still think that?
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you"
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do
Everybody so fake, I swear
Why the fuck do everybody act like they care?
I run away from my problems
I do the drugs when I want 'em
Pain pills with my coke, girl (Coke, girl)
You were everything I know, girl
Take me, away from here
Don't bother me with no drama
Now you want me, took a lot to make you want me now
Told her: "Baby, I'm the type to get faded"
White girl on me, I got cocaine
She don't love me, she just love how I feel
Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Where I wanna be again and again. Alone, you and me, skin to skin
Lil Bo Peep with a brand new bitch
In the back of the club with the GothBoiClique
Iced out teeth, want an iced out whip
With the limousine tints, you can suck my dick
Friends switch up when you in a Benz truck
Hoes wanna fuck 'cause I just came up, yeah
All the hate don't phase me
Only do it for the pain, it be fuckin' up my brain
Yeah, I do them drugs
I don't really give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, mane, ayy
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous
If you give me time, I could work on it
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
GothBoiClique, we got big dreams
GothBoiClique, tryna stay clean, yeah
GothBoiClique 'til my soul take
GothBoiClique in the back, ho
Man, it's gettin' real, it's the pain pills
You could be my girl if I could be your world
Sittin' drinkin' whiskey, hopin' that you'll miss me
Girl, I felt your heart beatin' heavy for me
Lookin' for a reason to live, I can't find shit
So, I'm squeezin' the trigger, I let my mind split
Lil' broke boy with a gold tooth
I remember livin' life like you
Smokin' on boof
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
These drugs gon' kill me, yeah
I'll be by your side, let's get high, just one last time
I don't wanna stop now, I don't wanna stop now
First, I cut you off, then I cut you down
Shit go off, when I come around
Speedin' down the highway, lookin' at the street lights
Knowin' I hurt you, I don't deserve you
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I got this vibe, I swear she love gettin' high too
Oh, I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah, I know
Oh, it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo' sho'
I don't even know, if I give a fuck about anything
Ride till the wheels fall off and my heart stop
Can't stop, girl you know I can't stop, won't stop
Live forever with a smile stuck on your face
You think he know you, but I know you the most, girl
Long nights, gettin' high on the coast, girl
I'm dyin', I don't think that my bitch know
I'm dyin', yeah, yeah
You will never find another one just like me
Nothin' worse than losin' a friend
And the feelin' you get when everybody that you love ain't around
Baby, I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, girl, not at all
Little bit of love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it all
Satan letting me down
Thoughts run through my mind
Girl, I'm gon' be fine
Trying to get you high off something that only I supply
Yeah, I'm talkin' that make you want to die
I'm talkin' that make you want to cry
Everybody here know that I'ma get my shine
Everybody here know that I'm one of a kind
All I really fuckin' know is stayin' on my grind, ayy
'Cause we live, and we love
And they lie, but we trust
We live, and we love
And they lie, but we trust
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Ask me if I'm alright, do you want me to lie?
Yeah, I do them drugs, I don't give a fuck what you think
I got blood, I got mud, I got bud, I got drank
I think about her every time that I sniff blow
